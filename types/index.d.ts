     * ### Executing code before sending the response and after creating your
     * html is a bad pattern and should be avoided!
     *
     * This function must be called **manually** at the top of the route handler

     * before the request finishes, a memory leak will be created. Make sure

     * by `streamHtml`.

     * @example
     * 
     * ```tsx
     * app.get('/bad', (_, reply) => {
     *   const html = <Layout /> // Error: Request data was deleted before all
     *                           // suspense components were resolved.
